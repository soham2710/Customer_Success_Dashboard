        The customer journey is a critical framework used to understand and optimize the path that customers take from their first interaction with a brand to their final purchase and beyond. This journey is typically segmented into the following stages:

        - **Awareness**: This is the initial stage where potential customers first become aware of your product or service. It's crucial to attract their attention and create a positive first impression.
        - **Consideration**: At this stage, customers are actively considering your product or service as a potential solution to their needs. They compare it with other options available in the market.
        - **Purchase**: This is the stage where the customer makes the decision to buy your product or service. Effective strategies are needed to convert prospects into paying customers.
        - **Retention**: After the purchase, the focus shifts to retaining customers by ensuring they have a positive experience with the product or service. Retention efforts help build customer loyalty.
        - **Advocacy**: In this final stage, satisfied customers become advocates for your brand. They recommend your product or service to others, leading to new customer acquisitions.

        In our simulated data, we have captured the count of customers at each stage and their conversion rates. Let's explore the data in detail:
        - **Stage**: Represents the different stages in the customer journey.
        - **Count**: The number of customers at each stage.
