## Customer Success Projects

This repository contains two advanced Customer Success use cases implemented using Streamlit and TensorFlow:
1. Customer Journey Mapping and Optimization
2. Customer Success Playbooks Using Predictive Analytics

## Project 1: Customer Journey Mapping and Optimization

### Objective:
Develop detailed customer journey maps and use data analytics to optimize each touchpoint for better customer experiences.

### Features:
- Visual journey maps of the customer lifecycle.
- Data analytics to identify bottlenecks and opportunities for improvement.
- Machine learning model to predict customer satisfaction.

### Implementation:
- Uses Streamlit for the UI.
- TensorFlow for building predictive models.
- Pandas and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

## Project 2: Customer Success Playbooks Using Predictive Analytics

### Objective:
Develop dynamic playbooks that use predictive analytics to guide customer success teams in delivering tailored support and proactive engagement.

### Features:
- Predictive modeling using historical data.
- Dynamic playbooks that adapt based on predictive insights.
- Personalized engagement strategies.
- Performance metrics tracking.

### Implementation:
- Uses Streamlit for the UI.
- TensorFlow for building predictive models.
- Scikit-learn for data preprocessing and model evaluation.
